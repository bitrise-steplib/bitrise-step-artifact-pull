        The list of the stage and workflow
        paths, which can generate artifacts.
      description: |-
        A comma separated list of workflows and stage
        paths, which can generate artifacts.
        You need to use the {stage}.{workflow} syntax.
        The "dot" character is the delimiter between
        the stage and the workflow.
        You can use wildrards in the expression.
        If you leave it empty, the default value
        will be the "*" (star), that means, it will
        get every artifacts from every workflow.
        Examples:
          - stage1.workflow1 - Gets the artifacts
          form the stage1's workflow1.
          - stage1.* - Gets all artifacts
          form the stage1's workflows.
          - *workflow1 - Gets the workflow1s'
          artifacts form all stages.
          - * - Gets every generated artifacts
          in the pipeline.
