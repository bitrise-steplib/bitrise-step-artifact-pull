title: Pull Pipeline intermediate files
summary: Pull intermediate files generated by the Pipeline Builds.
description: |-
  The step downloads intermediate files (build artifacts generated by the pipeline workflows,
  that are intended to be shared with subsequent workflows of the pipeline) to a local folder.

  These artifacts can be uploaded by the [Deploy to Bitrise.io step](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/deploy-to-bitrise-io),
  via specifying the *Files to share between pipeline stages* input.

  Pipeline intermediate files have an environment variable key assigned,
  after downloading the given artifact, an environment variable (with the assigned key) will point to the file's local path.

  Directories specified in *Files to share between pipeline stages* input will be archived and uploaded as a single file.
  After downloading, they are extracted, and the specified environment variable will point to the directory's local path.

  By default, all artifacts generated by any workflow of the pipeline are downloaded.
  This can be limited by setting the *Artifact source* input.

  Please note that this step is designed to be executed on the CI only.

      A comma (`,`) separated list of the stage and workflow
      paths, which generated artifacts to download.

      You need to use the `{stage}.{workflow}` syntax.
      The dot character (`.`) is the delimiter between the stage and the workflow.

      You can use regular expressions.
      The default value (`.*`) means: get every artifact from every workflow.

      Do not forget to escape the special characters.
