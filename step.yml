  ## Input configuration

  ### artifact_sources
  A comma separated list of workflows and stage
  paths, which can generate artifacts.
  You need to use the {stage}.{workflow} syntax.
  The "dot" character is the delimiter between
  the stage and the workflow.
  You can use wildcards in the expression.
  If you leave it empty, the default value
  will be the "*" (star), which means, it will
  get every artifact from every workflow.


  #### Examples
  1. stage1.workflow1 - Gets the artifacts
    from the stage1's workflow1.
  1. stage1.* - Gets all artifacts
    from the stage1's workflows.
  1. *workflow1 - Gets the workflows'
    artifacts from all stages.
  1. * - Gets every generated artifacts
    in the pipeline.
