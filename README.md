# Pull Pipeline intermediate files

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/steps-artifact-pull?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-artifact-pull/releases)

The Step downloads Pipeline intermediate files to a local folder.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

The Step downloads Pipeline intermediate files to a local folder.
These intermediate files are build artifacts generated by Workflows in a Pipeline intended to be shared with subsequent Workflows.

Make sure to add this Step after you have uploaded the intermediate files.
You can upload the intermediate files using the [Deploy to Bitrise.io Step](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/deploy-to-bitrise-io)'s **Files to share between pipeline stages** input.
The directories you specify will be archived and uploaded as a single file.

When uploading the Pipeline intermediate files, you must assign environment variable keys to them in the **Files to share between pipeline stages** input.
After downloading the files, the environment variable key will point to the file's local path.

When downloading an artifact, that was a directory originally, they are extracted,
and the specified environment variable will point to the directory's local path.

By default, all artifacts generated by any workflow of the pipeline are downloaded.
This can be limited by setting the *Artifact source* input.

Please note that this step is designed to be executed on the CI only.

### Configuring the Step

To configure the Step:

1. Specify which workflows' artifacts to download in the **Artifact source** input. By default, all workflows artifacts will be downloaded.

  NOTE: You can list multiple artifacts by separating them using a comma. For example: `{stage1}.{workflow1},{stage2}.{workflow2}`

2. (Optional) Set the **Enable verbose logging** input to `true` if you want to log additional information for debugging purposes.

## 🧩 Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).

#### Examples

##### Basic step config

```yaml
steps:
  - git::https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-artifact-pull.git@main:
      title: Pull artifacts
      inputs:
        - verbose: "true"
        - artifact_sources: stage-1.*
```

Use the `artifact_sources` input variable to limit the downloads to a set of stages or workflows:

- `stage1.workflow1` - Gets the artifacts from the stage1's workflow1.
- `stage1.*` - Gets all artifacts from the stage1's workflows.
- `*workflow1` - Gets the workflows' artifacts from all stages.
- `*` - Gets every generated artifacts in the pipeline.

##### Wildcard based artifact pull

During a pipeline, workflows receive the finished stages and workflows object. Developers can find it on a build VM's environment variable: `BITRISEIO_FINISHED_STAGES`.

Let's suppose that we get the following JSON object about the previously finished stages and workflows.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "083aa861-55b1-4132-ba70-0dfcd48fe929",
    "name": "stage-1",
    "workflows": [
      {
        "external_id": "73d33fb5-35c6-495f-bd80-015ae681db33",
        "finished_at": "2021-12-07T14:04:45Z",
        "id": "b1c6f0a1-06e7-4f63-a172-ac541a467d71",
        "name": "placeholder",
        "started_at": "2021-12-07T14:04:27Z",
        "status": "succeeded"
      },
      {
        "external_id": "39404bee-52ba-4ca2-8508-91489e7f6afa",
        "finished_at": "2021-12-07T14:05:07Z",
        "id": "f3bda7bb-37be-409f-9291-b377717cba60",
        "name": "textfile_generator",
        "started_at": "2021-12-07T14:04:48Z",
        "status": "succeeded"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "4919fe0e-877a-45ca-ab25-7da2ddf54bce",
    "name": "stage-2",
    "workflows": [
      {
        "external_id": "ed0da0cf-66cc-4109-b23f-8a156d61b0c3",
        "finished_at": "2021-12-07T14:06:41Z",
        "id": "f572ca4e-2f06-40f1-a4cf-c208af15ff28",
        "name": "deployer",
        "started_at": "2021-12-07T14:06:13Z",
        "status": "succeeded"
      },
      {
        "external_id": "05130ce4-825b-4ca1-a9be-4f54413e5dcd",
        "finished_at": "2021-12-07T14:07:04Z",
        "id": "861fd1be-48b1-4a6b-ae4c-ee5449eaa6b6",
        "name": "textfile_generator",
        "started_at": "2021-12-07T14:06:45Z",
        "status": "succeeded"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

As the key names in the object are self-describing, we will not cover those names except the `external_id`. The `external_id` is the build's slug in the PipelineService context.

Let's see the following use-cases, the use cases first part is the demand, the second is the `artifact_sources` config:

- As a developer, I would like to get the build artifact(s) of the _stage-1_'s _placeholder_'s workflow: `stage-1.placeholder`.

- As a developer, I would like to get the build artifact(s) of the _stage-2_'s _deployer_'s workflow and the _stage-1_'s _placeholder_'s workflow: `stage-1.placeholder,stage-2.deployer`. The two expressions are separated by a comma.

- As a developer, I would like to retrieve already generated artifacts: `*` or `"" (empty string)`. As the example shows, developers can use wildcard expressions.

- As a developer, I would like to retrieve the generated artifacts from the _stage-2_ stage: `stage-2.*`.

- As a developer, I would like to get the _textfile_generator_ workflow artifacts: `*.textfile_generator`

And so on. The syntax is: `{stage-name}.{workflow-name}`.

The results will be in the `$BITRISE_ARTIFACT_PATHS` env. var. The list is delimited with a `|` pipe character.

```bash
$BITRISE_ARTIFACT_PATHS = /var/folders/sd/lvn5cp9x5dn_xh1vhfgjjjw40000gp/T/_artifact_pull3010595419/generated_text_file.txt|/var/folders/sd/lvn5cp9x5dn_xh1vhfgjjjw40000gp/T/_artifact_pull3010595419/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `artifact_sources` | A comma (`,`) separated list of the Stage and Workflow paths, used to specify which workflows' artifacts to download.  The input uses a `{stage}.{workflow}` syntax.

| `app_slug` | The slug that uniquely identifies your app on bitrise.io. It’s part of the app URL, too. | required | `$BITRISE_APP_SLUG` |
| `finished_stage` | This is a JSON representation of the finished stages for which the step can download build artifacts. | required | `$BITRISEIO_FINISHED_STAGES` |
| `bitrise_api_base_url` | The base URL of the Bitrise API used to process the download requests. | required | `https://api.bitrise.io` |
